## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of open-source implementations for basic machine learning methods. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced practitioner wanting to revisit the basics, you'll find code examples and explanations here.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code in this repository for educational purposes, experimentation, or integration into your projects. Each directory corresponds to a specific machine learning method, containing the necessary code and accompanying documentation.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into directories based on different machine learning methods. Each directory contains a README file with specific instructions and explanations related to that method.

## Implemented Methods

### Gradient Descent

[Gradient Descent](Gradient_Descent/README.md) is a fundamental optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning for finding the minimum of a function.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

[K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)/README.md) is a simple and effective classification and regression algorithm based on the idea of similarity.

### Naive Bayes

[Naive Bayes](Naive_Bayes/README.md) is a probabilistic algorithm commonly used for classification tasks, especially in natural language processing.

### Perceptron

[Perceptron](Perceptron/README.md) is a basic building block of neural networks and serves as a binary classifier.
